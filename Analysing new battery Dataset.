Battery Model Identification
Based on the voltage range (40.5V-85.8V) and capacity values, this appears to be a lithium-ion battery pack for electric vehicle applications, likely with these characteristics:

Chemistry: Lithium-ion (based on voltage curve and SOC-voltage relationship)
Configuration: Approximately 20-24 cells in series (based on max voltage ~85.8V)
Capacity: ~2000Ah (pack level) with ~27Ah per cell
Energy: ~1992Wh at full charge
Application: Most likely an electric vehicle battery or stationary energy storage system

Experimental Considerations
The relationship between AFP and CRC reveals important experimental conditions:

Aging Testing: The data shows controlled cycling (0-122 cycles) with capacity measurements
Temperature Range: Tests conducted between ambient temperature and 62°C
Sampling Methodology:

Regular sampling intervals (mostly ~100-200 seconds)
Data collection focused on specific cycle counts


Capacity Degradation:

Initial capacity: 1998 (likely Ah)
After 24 cycles: reduced to 1859 (-7%)
Non-linear pattern suggests different testing regimes or conditions


Charge/Discharge Protocol:

Complete cycles recorded
Multiple charging events (ct.1) within each cycle
Data includes both charging and discharging phases (based on voltage patterns)



The relationship between SOC and voltage shows a typical lithium-ion curve with:

Steep rise between 90-100% SOC
More gradual slope in mid-range (30-70%)
Steeper decline below 20%

Key Insights

The perfect matching between SOE and calculated cre/afp ratios (difference ~0.5%) confirms the energy calculation methodology.
The SOH values show minimal degradation in early cycles, suggesting:

Either a robust battery design
Or controlled testing conditions minimizing stress factors


The non-linear progression of cycle counts indicates selective testing at specific milestones rather than continuous cycling.
The discrete AFP values suggest the battery underwent distinct capacity loss events, possibly related to specific test conditions or cell balancing procedures.
